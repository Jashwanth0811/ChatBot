","The Constitution comprises 5 articles: Bill of Rights (I); The Legislature (II); Judicial Branch (III); Executive Branch (IV) and Miscellaneaous (V). ","American Samoa, an unincorporated territory of the United States, is administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior. It is unincorporated because not all provisions of the U.S. Constitution apply to the territory. The American Samoa Constitution provides for an elected governor, lieutenant governor, and legislature. The bicameral legislature of American Samoa, known as the Fono, is comprised of a Senate and House of Representatives. There is also the traditional village politics: the Matai (chiefs) are elected by consensus within the Fono of the extended family and village(s) concerned. The Matai and the Fono (composed of Matai) decide on distribution of family exchanges and tenancy of communal lands. The majority of lands in American Samoa and independent Samoa are communal ","According to the constitution of 1967, the territory’s chief executive, is the governor. In 1976 American Samoans approved a referendum that provided for the popular election of the governor and lieutenant governor for four-year terms; prior to that time, the governor was appointed by the U.S. government. American Samoa has a bicameral legislature, called the Fono, which meets for two sessions each year. It is autonomous in its disposition of local revenues and is the sole lawmaking body, although the governor has the power to veto legislation. The members of American Samoa’s House of Representatives (lower house) are elected by universal suffrage to two-year terms. Members of the Senate (upper house) are chosen by councils of chiefs, in accordance with Samoan custom, to serve four-year terms. The United States is responsible for defense. The islands are divided into several administrative districts (each with an appointed district governor), which are subdivided into counties. The influence of the extended families (aiga) reaches to the district level. The aiga are headed by chiefs (matai), who are selected by their extended families on the basis of consensus. Most chiefs’ titles are very old. The matai together make up village and district councils (fono), which control and run local affairs. This autonomous village control is linked with the central government through the district governors, who are appointed by the governor. The highest legal authority is the High Court, which is headed by a chief justice and associate justices, all appointed by the U.S. secretary of the interior. The High Court has appellate, trial, and land and titles divisions. Each village has a village court with authority to adjudicate matters pertaining to village rules and local customs. District courts hear preliminary felony proceedings, certain cases arising from the village courts, and civil and small claims. ","No specific provisions.

It consists of several documents. The most important is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, approved in referendums by the people of the Australian colonies and enacted on 1 January 1901 as a section of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Imp), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. As Australia is now an independent country only the Australian people can amend it (Section 128 provides that constitutional amendments must be approved by a referendum). Letters patent issued by the Crown, on the advice of Australian ministers, are also part of the Constitution of Australia. Other pieces of legislation have constitutional significance for Australia. The Australia Act 1986, which was passed in equivalent forms by the Parliaments of every Australian state, the United Kingdom, and the Australian Federal Parliament, eliminated the remaining ties between the legislature and judiciary of Australia and their counterparts in the United Kingdom. The High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia have the authority to interpret constitutional provisions. Their decisions determine the interpretation and application of the constitution ","The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Imp) contains a Preamble, and nine sections. Sections 1 – 8 are covering clauses outlining the legal procedures for the establishment of the Commonwealth. Section 9, beginning with the words The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows ..., contains the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Constitution itself is divided into eight chapters, containing 128 sections: The Parliament (I); The Executive Government (II); The Judicature (III); Trade (IV); The States (V); New States (VI); Miscellaneous (VII) and Alteration of the Constitution (VIII). ","The form of government used in Australia is a constitutional monarchy, 'constitutional' because the powers and procedures of the Australian Government are defined by a written constitution, and 'monarchy' because Australia's head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. The Constitution created a 'federal' system of government. Under the federal system, powers are divided between a central government and 6 individual states.Territories are areas within Australia's borders that are not claimed by one of the six states. Territories can be administered by the Australian Government, or they can be granted a right of self-government. Self-government allows a territory to establish its own government in a similar manner to a state. The Constitution of Australia allows territories to become states with the approval of the Commonwealth legislature. ","The three separate chapters dealing with the three branches of government implies a separation of powers, similar to that of the United States, but unusual for a government within the Westminster system. Thus, for example, the legislature cannot purport to predetermine the legal outcome, or to change the direction or outcome, of a court case. Powers of government are divided between the Commonwealth and the State governments, with certain powers being exclusive to the Commonwealth, others being concurrently exercised, and the remainder being held by the States ","No specific provisions. ","The Australian constitution does not include a Bill of Rights. Some express rights were, however, included: Section 80 creates a right to trial by jury for indictable offences against Commonwealth law; Paragraph 51(xxxi) creates a right to just compensation for assets taken by the Commonwealth; Section 116 creates a right to freedom of religion; Section 117 prohibits disability or discrimination in one state against the resident of another state. ","No explicit mention of the right to clean, healthy and sustainable environment. ","No specific provisions. ","No explicit mention of the right to food.

It is split up over many different acts. Its centerpiece is the Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz (B-VG of 1920 as amended in 1929, which includes the Staatsgrundgesetz (StGG, Basic Law of the State) of 1867, the Treaty of St. Germain of 1919 and the Treaty of Vienna, 1955), with the most important federal constitutional provisions. Apart from the B-VG, there are a large number of other constitutional acts and individual provisions in statutes and treaties which are designated as constitutional (Verfassungsbestimmung). Over time, both the B-VG and the numerous pieces of constitutional law supplementing it have undergone literally hundreds of minor and major amendments and revisions. The constitutional amendments need not be incorporated into the main text of the B-VG, or for that matter any of the more important parts of the constitutional body, but can be enacted as separate constitutional act, or even as a simple section within any act, simply designated as constitutional (Verfassungsbestimmung). ","The Constitution of Austria (Österreichische Bundesverfassung) is the body of all constitutional law of the Republic of Austria on the federal level. It is split up over many different acts. ","The federal constitution defines Austria itself as a bicameral parliamentary democracy with near-complete separation of powers. Federal legislative powers are vested with a body the constitution refers to as a parliament. Most closely resembling a bill of rights in Austria is the Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals of the Kingdoms and Laender represented in the Council of the Realm, a decree issued by Emperor Franz Josef on December 21, 1867. Since then, other civil liberties have been set out in other constitutional laws, and Austria is party to the European Convention of Human Rights, which, too, has been implemented as a directly applicable constitutional law in Austria. ","Austria's parliament consists of two houses, the National Council and the Federal Council. Austrian federal legislation always originates in the National Council, never in the Federal Council. Bills passed by the National Council are sent to the Federal Council for affirmation. If the Federal Council approves of the bill or simply does nothing for a period of eight weeks, the bill has succeeded. Bills passed by both houses are ultimately signed into law by the federal president. The president does not have the power to veto bills. Adjudicating upon the constitutionality of the bill itself is the exclusive prerogative of the Constitutional Court. Federal executive authority is vested with the federal president, an official elected by popular vote for a term of six years and limited to two consecutive terms of office. The president is the head of state and appoints the federal cabinet, a body consisting of the federal chancellor and a number of ministers. The president also appoints the members of the Constitutional Court and numerous other public officials, represents the republic in international relations, accredits foreign ambassadors, and acts as the nominal commander in chief of Austria's armed forces. Federal and state judicial authority, in particular responsibility for judicial review of administrative acts, lies with the Administrative and Constitutional Court System. The Constitutional Court examines the constitutionality of laws passed by Parliament, the legality of regulations by Federal ministers and finally alleged infringements of constitutional rights of individuals through acts of the administration. It also tries disputes between the federation and its member states, demarcation disputes between other courts and impeachments of the federal president (serving as State Court in that matter). The Administrative Court tries all kinds of cases which involve ex officio decisions by public officials or bodies and which are not dealt with by the Constitutional Court. ","The generally recognized rules of international law are regarded as integral parts of Federal law (art. 9-1).

Amendments to the constitution must be done in accordance with Part V of the Constitution Act, 1982, which provides for five different amending formulae. Amendments can be brought forward under section 46(1) by any province or either level of the federal government. The general formula is set out in section 38(1), known as the 7/50 formula, requires: (a) assent from both the House of Commons and the Senate; (b) the approval of two-thirds of the provincial legislatures (at least seven provinces) representing at least 50% of the population (effectively, this would include at least Quebec or Ontario, as they are the most populous provinces). This formula specifically applies to amendments related to the proportionate representation in Parliament, powers, selection, and composition of the Senate, the Supreme Court and the addition of provinces or territories. The other amendment formulae are for exceptional cases as provided by in the act. ","The Constitution of Canada is said to include: (a) the Canada Act 1982 (which includes the Constitution Act, 1982 in Schedule B), (b) 30 Acts and Orders contained in the Schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982 (including, most significantly, the Constitution Act, 1867), and (c) any amendments which may have been made to any of the instruments in the first two categories. ","Canada is a constitutional monarchy. The powers of government are divided between the provinces and the federal government and are described in sections 91 to 95 of the Act. Sections 91 and 92 are of particular importance, as they enumerate the subjects for which each jurisdiction can enact law, with section 91 listing matters of federal jurisdiction and section 92 listing matters of provincial jurisdiction. Sections 92A and 93 are concerned with non-renewable natural resources and education, respectively (both are primarily provincial responsibilities). Section 94 leaves open a possible change to laws regarding property and civil rights, which so far has not been realized. Sections 95 addresses matters of shared jurisdiction, namely agriculture and immigration Section 92(13) gives the provinces the exclusive power to make law related to property and civil rights in the province, giving them authority over numerous matters such as professional trades, labour relations, and consumer protection. ","Three branches work together to govern Canada: the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The executive branch is made up of the Monarch represented by the Governor General, the Prime Minister, and the Cabinet. The legislative branch is made up of the appointed Senate and the elected House of Commons. The judicial branch is a series of independent courts that interpret the laws passed by the other two branches. Canada is a federation with two distinct jurisdictions of political authority: the country-wide federal government and the ten provincial governments. It has three territorial governments in the far north that exercise delegated powers under the authority of the Parliament of Canada. All three jurisdictions are linked together by the Canadian Crown, from which all derive their sovereignty and authority; each government includes the Queen-in-Parliament, the Queen-in-Council, and the Queen-on-the-Bench. The federal parliament and the provincial assemblies are generally independent of one another in their respective areas of legislative authorityShared sectors include agriculture and immigration, but most are either entirely within federal jurisdiction, such as foreign affairs and telecommunications, or entirely within provincial jurisdiction, such as education and healthcare. ","No specific provisions. ","Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982. is formed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (35 Sections). The Charter is the constitutional guarantee of collective and individual rights as it outlines the civil rights and liberties of every citizen in Canada, such as freedom of expression, of religion, and of mobility. The Charter guarantees certain political rights to Canadian citizens and civil rights of everyone in Canada from the policies and actions of all levels of government. Particular importance is given to language rights: generally, the right to use either the English or French language in communications with Canada's federal government and certain provincial governments: Under Section 16: English and French are the official languages of Canada and New Brunswick. ","No provisions regarding the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. ","No provisions regarding the right to property. ","No explicit mention of the right to food. ","No explicit mention of the right to water. ","Article 15 sets forth that every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. Section 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 1982: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons. ","Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes and affirms the existing aboriginal and treaty rights in Canada. These aboriginal rights protect the activities, practice, or traditions that are integral to the distinctive culture of the aboriginal peoples. The treaty rights protect and enforce agreements in between the crown and the aboriginal peoples. Section 35 also provides protection of aboriginal title which protects the use of land for traditional practices. These rights extend to people who make up the Indian, Inuit, and Métis peoples. section 35.1 sets expectations for aboriginal participation in the amendment of relevant constitutional provisions. Other sections of the Constitution Act, 1982 that address aboriginal rights include section 25 of the Charter which atates that aboriginal rights and freedoms shall be left unharmed by Charter. ","No specific provisions. ","Sections 25 and 35 are also about the protection of aboriginal land rights. ","All Lands, Mines, Minerals, and Royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick at the Union, and all Sums then due or payable for such Lands, Mines, Minerals, or Royalties, shall belong to  the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any Trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any Interest other than that of the Province in the same.

La propiedad privada es inviolable. Nadie puede ser privado de su propiedad sino en virtud de sentencia judicial, pero se admite la expropiación por causa de utilidad pública o de interés social, que será determinada en cada caso por ley. Esta garantizará el previo pago de una justa indemnización, establecida convencionalmente o por sentencia judicial, salvo los latifundios improductivos destinados a la reforma agraria, conforme con el procedimiento para las expropiaciones a establecerse por ley.

Los artículos 64 y 65 se refieren a la propiedad comunitaria y a la participación de los pueblos indígenas. ","En materia ambiental, constituyen objetivos prioritarios de interés social la preservación, la conservación, la recomposición y el mejoramiento del ambiente, así como su conciliación con el desarrollo humano integral. Estos propósitos orientarán la legislación y la política gubernamental pertinente (art. 7). ","El artículo 116 está dedicado a los latifundios improductivos. Con el objeto de eliminar progresivamente los latifundios improductivos, la ley atenderá a la aptitud natural de las tierras, a las necesidades del sector de población vinculado con la agricultura y a las previsiones aconsejables para el desarrollo equilibrado de las actividades agrícolas, agropecuarias, forestales e industriales, así como al aprovechamiento sostenible de los recursos naturales y de la preservación del equilibrio ecológico. La expropiación de los latifundios improductivos destinados a la reforma agraria serán establecidas en cada caso por la ley, y se abonará en la forma y en el plazo que la misma determine. ","Asimismo el artículo 116 introduce como principio rector en tema de reforma agraria el aprovechamiento sostenible de los recursos naturales y de la preservación del equilibrio ecológico. ","La Constitución establece los objetivos y principios rectores de la reforma agraria, reconocida como uno de los factores fundamentales para lograr el bienestar rural. La misma consiste en la incorporación efectiva de la población campesina al desarrollo económico y social de la Nación.

","Honduras es un Estado de Derecho, soberano, constituido como República libre, democrática e independiente para asegurar a sus habitantes el goce de la justicia, la libertad, la cultura y el bienestar económico y social (art. 1). La soberanía corresponde al pueblo del cual emanan todos los poderes del Estado que se ejercen por representación (art. 2). El Gobierno de la República se sustenta en los principios de la  soberanía popular, la autodeterminación de los pueblos y la democracia participativa, de los cuales se derivan la integración nacional, que implica participación de todos los sectores políticos en la Administración Pública, la estabilidad política y la paz social (art. 5). ","La forma de gobierno es republicana, democrática y representativa. Se ejerce por tres poderes: Legislativo, Ejecutivo y Judicial, complementarios e independientes y sin relaciones de subordinación. La alternabilidad en el ejercicio de la Presidencia de la República es obligatoria.La infracción de esta norma constituye delito de traición a la patria (art. 4). El principio del Estado de Derecho es reconocido explícitamente en el artículo 1º. El Poder Legislativo se ejerce por un Congreso de Diputados, que serán elegidos por sufragio directo (art. 189). La titularidad del Poder Ejecutivo la ejerce en representación y para beneficio del pueblo el Presidente, y en su defecto, los Designados a la Presidencia de la República. El Presidente y tres Designados a la Presidencia de la República, serán elegidos conjunta y directamente por el pueblo, por simple mayoría de votos (arts. 235 y 236). El Poder Judicial se integra por una Corte Suprema de Justicia, por las Cortes de Apelaciones, los juzgados, por tribunales con competencia exclusiva en zonas del país sujetas a regímenes especiales creados por la Constitución de la República y demás dependencia que señale la Ley (art. 303). ","El artículo 16 contempla el proceso de ratificación de los tratados internacionales. Los tratados internacionales celebrados por Honduras con otros Estados, una vez que entran en vigor, forman parte del derecho interno. Cuando un tratado internacional afecte una disposición constitucional, debe ser aprobado por el procedimiento que rige la reforma de la Constitución, simultáneamente el precepto constitucional afectado debe ser modificado en el mismo sentido por el mismo procedimiento, antes de ser ratificado el Tratado por el Poder Ejecutivo (art. 17). Se reconoce la primacía del derecho internacional: en caso de conflicto entre el tratado o convención y la ley, prevalecerá el primero (art. 18). ","La persona humana es el fin supremo de la Sociedad y del Estado. Todos tienen la obligación de respetarla y protegerla. La dignidad del ser humano es inviolable.

Se reconoce primacía a estos derechos: no se aplicarán leyes y disposiciones gubernativas o de cualquier otro orden, que regulen el ejercicio de las declaraciones, derechos y garantías establecidos en esta Constitución, si los disminuyen, restringen o tergiversan (art. 64). El Título IV, por otro lado, establece y regula garantías constitucionales como el habeas corpus, habeas data y amparo. ","El artículo 145, tal como reformado en 2011, contempla derechos y deberes en tema de medio ambiente. Se reconoce el derecho a la protección de la salud. Es deber de todos participar en al promoción y preservación de la salud personal y de la comunidad. El Estado conservará el medio ambiente adecuado para proteger la salud de las personas. ","El Estado reconoce, fomenta y garantiza la existencia de la propiedad privada en su más amplio concepto de función social y sin más limitaciones que aquellas que por motivos de necesidad o de interés publico establezca la Ley (art. 103). El derecho de la propiedad no perjudica el dominio eminente del Estado. Los artículos 106 y 107 introducen reglas y principios en tema de expropiación y de adquisición o posesión de terrenos del Estado, ejidales, comunales o de propiedad privada situados en la zona limítrofe a los estados vecinos, o en el litoral de ambos mares. Dichos terrenos podrán ser adquiridos o poseídos o tenidos a cualquier título solamente por hondureños de nacimiento, por sociedades integradas en su totalidad por socios hondureños y por las instituciones del Estado, bajo pena de nulidad del respectivo acto o contrato.

En Honduras no hay clases privilegiadas. Todos los hondureños son iguales ante la Ley. Se declara punible toda discriminación por motivo de sexo, raza, clase y cualquier otra lesiva a la dignidad humana (art. 60). En tema de leyes que rigen las relaciones laborales, el artículo 128 dispone que a trabajo igual corresponde salario igual sin discriminación alguna. Por otro lado, en tema de no discriminación cabe asimismo mencionar el párrafo 2 del artículo 345 sobre la Reforma Agraria: la Reforma Agraria se ejecutará de manera que se asegure la eficaz participación de los campesinos, en condiciones de igualdad con los demás sectores de la producción, en el proceso de desarrollo económico, social y político de la nación.

","El Estado conservará el medio ambiente adecuado para proteger la salud de las personas (art. 145). ","El objetivo de la Reforma Agraria (arts. 344-350) sustituir el latifundio y el minifundio por un sistema de propiedad, tenencia y explotación de la tierra que garantice la justicia social en el campo y aumente la producción y la productividad del sector agropecuario.

El Estado se reserva la potestad de establecer o modificar la demarcación de las zonas de control y protección de los recursos naturales en el territorio nacional. ","Dentro del Título VI se dedica un capítulo entero a la Reforma Agraria (Capítulo III), cuya ejecución se declara de necesidad y utilidad pública. El texto constitucional define a la reforma agraria como proceso integral e instrumento de transformación de la estructura agraria del país, destinado a sustituir el latifundio y el minifundio por un sistema de propiedad, tenencia y explotación de la tierra que  garantice la justicia social en el campo y aumente la producción y la productividad del sector agropecuario. Los planes de Reforma Agraria del Instituto Nacional Agrario y las demás decisiones del Estado en materia agraria, se formularán y ejecutarán con la efectiva participación de las organizaciones de campesinos, agricultores y ganaderos legalmente reconocidas (art. 348). ","","","La reforestación del país y la conservación de bosques se declararan de conveniencia nacional y de interés colectivo (art. 340, párrafo 3). ","Ver el Capítulo III del Título VI sobre Reforma Agraria, que reconoce el rol de las organizaciones de ganaderos.

El Estado promoverá programas que aseguren una adecuada disponibilidad de alimentos y una distribución equitativa de los mismos (art. 63). ","","El Preámbulo hace referencia al principio de igualdad y no discriminación: “La institucionalización de las conquistas de la Revolución y la construcción de una nueva sociedad que elimine toda clase de explotación y logre la igualdad económica, política y social de los nicaragüenses y el respeto absoluto de los derechos humanos.” Se hace hincapié en el trato igualitario en tema de derechos laborales. En el marco de la Reforma Agraria, se prohíbe la discriminación por razones de género entre campesinos y campesinas (art. 109).

El Estado reconoce las formas comunales de propiedad de la tierra de las comunidades de la Costa Caribe. Igualmente reconoce el goce, uso y disfrute de las aguas y bosques de sus tierras comunales.

Se reconoce también que la madre tierra pertenece comunitariamente a todos los que la habitan y al conjunto de los ecosistemas (art. 60). En este sentido el Estado nicaragüense debe adoptar patrones de producción y consumo que garanticen la vitalidad y la integridad de la madre tierra, la equidad social en la humanidad, el consumo responsable y solidario y el buen vivir comunitario. Nicaragua además incorpora a su ordenamiento jurídico el texto íntegro de la Declaración Universal del Bien Común de la Tierra y de la Humanidad. ","La cuestión de la tierra y los derechos de propiedad es regulada en el marco de la Reforma Agraria, concebido como un instrumento fundamental para la democratización de la propiedad y la justa distribución de la tierra, para la promoción y estrategia global de la reconstrucción ecológica y el desarrollo económico sostenible del país. La Reforma Agraria tendrá en cuenta la relación tierra-hombre socialmente necesaria; también se garantiza las propiedades a los campesinos beneficiarios de la misma de acuerdo con la ley (art. 106). Se eliminará el latifundio ocioso y se hará prioritariamente con tierras del Estado. Cuando la expropiación de latifundios ociosos afecte a propietarios privados se hará cumpliendo con lo estipulado en el artículo 44, en tema de derecho a la propiedad privada. ","Los recursos naturales son patrimonio nacional.

Asimismo se promueve la incorporación voluntaria de pequeños y medianos productores agropecuarios a los planes de desarrollo económico y social del país, bajo formas asociativas e individuales. Los campesinos y demás sectores productivos tienen derecho de participar en la definición de las políticas de transformación agraria, por medio de sus propias organizaciones (arts. 109-111). ","Es obligación del Estado promover, facilitar y regular la prestación de, entre otros, los servicios públicos básicos de energía y agua (art. 105). ","","Se reconoce el disfrute de los bosques de las tierras comunales de las comunidades de la Costa Caribe. ","Artículo 110: El Estado promoverá la incorporación voluntaria de pequeños y medianos productores agropecuarios a los planes de desarrollo económico y social del país, bajo formas asociativas e individuales.

The Constitution entered into force on 1 January 2000, replacing the Constitution of 1874. The new Constitution was designed to make current constitutional law more transparent, to bring it into a systematic order, and to adjust its language and terminology to modern standards. The authority to amend the Constitution is derived from Title VI. All amendments to the Constitution must be submitted to the voters in a referendum in which both a majority of the cantons and a majority of all votes cast are needed for enactment. It also is possible for 50,000 Swiss citizens entitled to vote to initiate constitutional amendments. A suggested amendment must be supported by 100 000 citizens entitled to vote or by the Federal Parliament, and to be passed must be approved in a referendum by the People and the Cantons (arts. 138,139, 140, 194, 195). The Constitution of 1999 was last amended on 9 February 2014 and the present version consolidates all amendments up to this date. ","The text consists of 197 articles divided into 6 Titles as follows: General Provisions (I); Fundamental Rights, Citizenship and Social Goals (II); Confederation, Cantons and Communes (III); The People and the Cantons (IV); Federal Authorities (V); Revision of the Federal Constitution and Transitional Provisions (VI). ","","The Swiss federal government (the Swiss Confederation) consists of three branches – the Federal Assembly, a bicameral parliament; the Federal Council, an executive body of seven ministers elected by the Federal Assembly; and the Federal Tribunal, whose 30 judges and 15 substitute judges are elected by the Federal Assembly. Each canton has its own constitution, legislature, government and courts. Most of the cantons' legislature are unicameral parliaments, their size varying between 58 and 200 seats. Each Canton is free to organize its own judiciary system, according to its own rules of proceedings. Each Canton has its own courts, with local denominations and allocation of powers (article 191b). At federal level, the Federal Criminal Court, as court of first instance, decides criminal cases that fall within federal jurisdiction (e.g. offences involving explosives, organized crime) There is also a Federal Administrative Court, which hears appeals on rulings by federal administrative authorities. In the 26 cantons, there are generally several lower district courts, as well as a single supreme court or cantonal court that has jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters. Each canton also has a cantonal administrative court that also has jurisdiction over tribunals of lower instance which are often, though not exclusively, bodies within the relevant government authorities. For civil and criminal cases, the current cantonal procedural codes are in the process of being harmonized throughout Switzerland. The administration of justice is governed by the procedural law of each canton. One of the declared principles in the Swiss Constitution is the Rule of Law.

(2) State activities must be conducted in the public interest and be proportionate to the ends sought. (3) State institutions and private persons shall act in good faith. (4) The Confederation and the Cantons shall respect international law.

Article 193 (4): The mandatory provisions of international law must not be violated. ","Chapter 1 of Title 2 on “Fundamental Rights, Citizenship and Social Goals” makes expressively mention of the following human rights: Human dignity (art.7), Equality before the law (art. 8), Protection against arbitrary conduct and principle of good faith (9); Right to life and to personal freedom (art. 10), Protection of children and young people (art.11), Right to assistance when in need (12).

These principles are binding on the Cantons and serve to ensure the appropriate and economic use of the land and its properly ordered settlement. (2) The Confederation shall encourage and coordinate the efforts of the Cantons and shall cooperate with them. (3) Confederation and Cantons shall take account of the requirements of spatial planning in fulfilling their duties.” Article 75a on National Land Survey establishes that “(1) The National Land Survey is the responsibility of the Confederation. (2) The Confederation shall issue regulations on official surveying. (3) It may issue regulations on the harmonisation of official information relating to the land.” ","Sustainable development is a tenet to which the Swiss Confederation and the Cantons are bound.

If Cantons are unable to agree on rights to inter-cantonal water resources, the Confederation shall decide. (6) The Confederation shall take account of the concerns of the Cantons where the water originates in fulfilling its duties. Article 78 prescribes rules for the protection of natural and cultural heritage establishing that “(1)The protection of natural and cultural heritage is the responsibility of the Cantons.

Article 79 establishes that “The Confederation shall lay down principles on fishing and hunting and in particular on the preservation of the diversity of fish species, wild mammals and birds. Article 80deals with protection of animals. ","Since about one-third of Switzerland’s land is devoted to agricultural production (grains, fodder, vegetables, fruits, and vineyards) and pasture, the Swiss Constitution sets out the multifunctional tasks of agriculture. Rural development is one of the main responsibilities of Swiss agriculture, along with ensuring food supplies, conserving natural resources and preserving the rural landscape. Agriculture contributes substantially by way of a sustainable and market-oriented production among others, to the conservation of natural resources and the upkeep of rural scenery; the Confederation shall conceive the measures in such a way that agriculture may fulfil its multiple functions by complementing agricultural revenues by direct payments, to secure a fair and adequate remuneration for the services rendered, provided that compliance with ecological requirements is proven. It shall promote, by way of economic incentives, forms of production which are particularly close to nature and friendly to the environment and the animals. It shall protect the environment against pollution due to excessive use of fertilizers, chemicals and other auxiliary substances (art. 104).

The authority to amend the Constitution is derived from Chapter XI. The Prince of Monaco – together with the National Council - can veto constitutional amendments (art. 94). In case the National Council takes an initiative, the deliberations must be taken with a majority of two-thirds of its members (art. 95). The Constitution was last amended on 2 April 2002 re-defining the line of succession to the Monegasque throne. ","The Constitution of the Principality of Monaco consists of 97 articles divided into 12 Chapters as follows: The Principality – The Public Powers (I); The Prince, The Demise of the Crown (II); Fundamental Freedoms and Rights (III); Public Domain, Public Finance (IV); The Government (V); The State Council (VI); The National Council (VII); The Crown Council (VIII); The Commune (IX); The Justice (X); The Revision of the Constitution (XI); Final Provisions (XII). ","Article 1 of the Constitution affirms: The Principality of Monaco is a sovereign and independent State within the framework of the general principles of international law and of the particular conventions with France. The principle of government is the hereditary and constitutinoal monarchy (art. 2). Accession to the throne, aside causes of death or abdication, is reserved to the direct and legitimate descendent of the reigning Prince, by order of first born giving priority to the male descendent (art. 10). ","The Constitution determines the legislative, executive and judiciary powers (arts. 3, 4 and 5), by electing the individuals detaining their respectively defined and specifically attributed authority. Furthermore, it guarantees the checks and balances separation of the administrative, legislative and judiciary functions (art. 6). The executive power is retained by the highest authority, the Prince (art. 3) but is enforced by the Minister of State with the assistance of the Government, the Cabinet (art. 43) composed of three Counselors. The Cabinet collegially deliberates on the projects and laws which are presented to the Prince (art. 67). The Minister of State oversees the executive process in order to assure the enforcement of law, the functioning of the public services, as well as the maintenance of public order through the police forces (art. 44). The legislative powers are jointly exercised by the Prince and the National Council (art. 4).

The administration of justice is assured by the director of the judiciary services responsible for the surveillance over the magistrates, defense lawyers and barristers, police officers and ministerial officials. The jurisdictional administration of the Principality is characterized by the duality of the powers exercised, on the one hand, by the Supreme Court of Justice and on the other hand, by the judicial courts. The Principality is a State under the Rule of Law, committed to fundamental freedoms and rights (art. 2). ","The Prince represents the Principality in its foreign relations (art. 13), he signs and ratifies treaties after consultation with the Crowns Council (art. 14).

The Puntland State of Somalia was created in 1998 through a consultative agreement among the different regions that constitute its territory. In the constitutional conference of 1998 it was decided that Puntland would become a State that would be part of a federal Somalia. A charter was approved in that same 1998 conference and later replaced with a provisional constitution that was approved by members of the House of Representatives in 2001. The constitutional review process began in 2007 and continued until 2009. This new Constitution is based on the Islamic shari'a and on these guiding principles: (a) rule by the people; (b) good governance; (c) consultation; (d) promoting positive Somali culture and traditions; (e) advancing public interests over individual interests; and (f) multi-party competition and decentralization of power throughout Puntland (art. 3). The Constitution is composed of the following Titles: I) Founding principles of Puntland; II) Fundamental rights and individual protections; III)  Economy; IV) The structure of the State; V) Puntland system of administration; VI) Supremacy of and amendment to the Constitution and provisional enforcement. Title II recognizes the fundamental rights of individuals, including property rights: every person shall have the right to own, administer and benefit from property in accordance with the law. The conditions and procedures that may limit the right of property ownership shall be established by the law (art. 17). Moreover, article 53 provides that the legally-acquired property of a person may not be expropriated except for public interest in exchange for equitable compensation. Section II of Chapter I (under Title II) establishes the circumstances under which certain individual rights may be suspended, namely in case of State of emergency in the event of a war, foreign invasion, rebellion, natural disaster, epidemic or serious threat to public order or stability (art. 29). It is established that a state of emergency may be declared only for a period of not more than 30 days; if the conditions that prompted the emergency continue to affect the population, the state of emergency may be renewed for further periods of not more than 30 days and only by the House of Representatives. Chapter II of Title II aims at protecting social rights, giving special attention to the rights of children (see article 31 on the prohibition of child labour), right to health (art. 33) and social security (art. 38).  Article 35 regards the rights of women and stipulates that it is the duty of the State to protect and promote the rights of women, consistent with Islamic religious norms; women have the same rights as men, except the distinctions made by God between the two sexes. Title III establishes the principles and main rules governing the economic system, which shall be oriented to give all Puntlanders a way of life in accordance with their dignity as human beings, satisfying the basic needs of all the persons in the society, in accordance with the principles of social justice. These provisions set forth the principle of free enterprise (both local and foreign), define the role of the State in the economy and further refer to publicly-owned companies. Puntland State shall promote sustainable economic development and cooperate with the private sector to increase production and entrepreneurism. Support to small-scale producers and cooperatives shall have special priority (art. 50). It is worth mentioning the following provisions included under Title III on the economic system: article 54 on natural resources and article 55 on protection of the environment. Puntland natural resources belong to the people of Puntland, and the State may make agreements with national or foreign companies to give them the right to benefit from natural resources. Permission to benefit from the natural resources of Puntland shall be granted by the Council of Ministers and approved by the House of Representatives. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of the State and of all Puntland citizens to restore and protect the environment; this duty shall be clearly stated in all contracts and all contracts shall be consistent with the environmental protection laws.

Fue reformada en 2014 con el objeto de reconocer a los pueblos indígenas e implementar medidas orientadas a preservar y promover su identidad étnica y cultural, su cosmovisión, valores y espiritualidad. ","El texto de la Constitución consta de 274 artículos, organizados en los siguientes Títulos: I) La persona humana y los fines del Estado; II) Los derechos y garantías fundamentales de la persona; III) El Estado, su forma de gobierno y sistema político; IV) La nacionalidad; V) Orden económico; VI) Organos del gobierno, atribuciones y competencias; VII) Régimen administrativo; VIII) Responsabilidad de los funcionarios públicos; IX) Alcances, aplicación, reformas y derogatorias; X) Disposiciones transitorias; XI) Vigencia. ","El Salvador es un Estado soberano. La soberanía reside en el pueblo, que la ejerce en la forma prescrita y dentro de los límites de esta Constitución. El Gobierno es republicano, democrático y representativo. El sistema político es pluralista y se expresa por medio de los partidos políticos, que son el único instrumento para el ejercicio de la representación del pueblo dentro del Gobierno. Las normas, organización y funcionamiento se sujetarán a los principios de la democracia representativa (art. 85). Dentro de los fines del Estado, se reconoce a la persona humana como el origen y el fin de la actividad del Estado, que está organizado para la consecución de la justicia, de la seguridad jurídica y del bien común. Asimismo se reconoce como persona humana a todo ser humano desde el instante de la concepción. Es obligación del Estado asegurar a los habitantes de la República, el goce de la libertad, la salud, la cultura, el bienestar económico y la justicia social (art. 1). ","Existen tres poderes: el Poder Legislativo, ejercido por la Asamblea Legislativa, que es un cuerpo colegiado integrado por diputados (art. 121); el Poder Ejecutivo, desempeñado por el Presidente y el Vicepresidente de la República, los Ministros y Viceministros de Estado y sus funcionarios dependientes (art. 150); el Poder Judicial, integrado por  la Corte Suprema de Justicia, las Cámaras de Segunda Instancia y los demás tribunales que establezcan las leyes secundarias (art. 172). El artículo 86 reconoce el Estado de Derecho: el poder público emana del pueblo; los órganos del Gobierno lo ejercerán independientemente dentro de las respectivas atribuciones y competencias establecidas en esta Constitución y las leyes; los funcionarios del Gobierno son delegados del pueblo y no tienen más facultades que las que expresamente les da la ley. ","Se reconoce la supremacía de los tratados internacionales: los tratados internacionales celebrados por El Salvador con otros Estados o con organismos internacionales, constituyen leyes de la República al entrar en vigencia, conforme a las disposiciones del mismo tratado y de esta Constitución. La ley no podrá modificar o derogar lo acordado en un tratado vigente para El Salvador. En caso de conflicto entre el tratado y la ley, prevalecerá el tratado (art. 144). Por otro lado, el artículo 146 establece que no podrán celebrarse o ratificarse tratados u otorgarse concesiones en que de alguna manera se altere la forma de gobierno o se lesionen o menoscaben la integridad del territorio, la soberanía e independencia de la República o los derechos y garantías fundamentales de la persona humana. ","El Título II de la Constitución reconoce y protege los derechos y garantías fundamentales de la persona, que incluyen los derechos individuales (Capítulo I); los derechos sociales (Capítulo II); los derechos y deberes políticos (Capítulo III). Los derechos individuales contemplan el derecho a la vida, a la integridad física y moral, a la libertad, a la seguridad. El artículo 29 regula el régimen de excepción a los derechos individuales en caso de guerra, invasión del territorio, rebelión, sedición, catástrofe, epidemia u otra calamidad general, o de graves perturbaciones del orden público. En el marco de los derechos sociales se regulan el derecho al trabajo, a la seguridad social, a la educación y a la salud. ","El texto de la Constitución no reconoce de manera explícita el derecho a un medio ambiente sano, limpio y sostenible. Ver el artículo 117. ","Se reconoce el derecho a la propiedad privada. Toda persona tiene derecho a disponer libremente de sus bienes conforme a la ley. La propiedad es transmisible en la forma en que determinen las leyes. Habrá libre testamentifacción (art. 22). Otras disposiciones en tema de propiedad se encuentran bajo el Título V, sobre el orden económico, que responde a la justicia social. Se reconoce y garantiza el derecho a la propiedad privada en función social (art. 103). ","No se reconoce de manera explícita el derecho a la alimentación. En tema de derecho al trabajo, el artículo 37 hace referencia a condiciones dignas de vida: el trabajo es una función social, goza de la protección del Estado, y no se considera artículo de comercio. El Estado empleará todos los recursos que estén a su alcance para proporcionar ocupación al trabajador, manual o intelectual, y para asegurar a él y a su familia las condiciones económicas de una existencia digna. En el mismo sentido, véase el párrafo 2 del artículo 38. Por otro lado, el artículo 101 establece que el orden económico debe responder esencialmente a principios de justicia social, que tiendan a asegurar a todos los habitantes del país una existencia digna del ser humano. ","Si bien el texto constitucional no se refiere explícitamente al derecho al agua, cabe señalar que la Sala de lo Constitucional de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, mediante sentencia de amparo 513-2012 del 15 de diciembre de 2014, sostiene que la Constitución sí protege el derecho al agua. En particular el razonamiento de la Corte es que el  derecho al medio ambiente (reconocido por el artículo 117) se compone del derecho al disfrute del medio ambiente, el derecho a que dicho medio ambiente sea preservado, y el derecho a estar protegido contra amenazas o lesiones a los dos derechos antes mencionados. Asimismo, cabe recordar  que la dimensión objetiva del amparo trasciende los efectos del caso particular, en el sentido de que la decisión de la Corte establece a partir de ese momento la correcta interpretación que ha de darse a la disposición constitucional que reconoce el derecho en  cuestión, la cual deberán tener en cuenta no solo los tribunales, sino también las autoridades y funcionarios de los otros Órganos del Estado cuando resuelvan los supuestos análogos que se les presenten. ","Todas las personas son iguales ante la ley. Para el goce de los derechos civiles no podrán establecerse restricciones que se basen en diferencias de nacionalidad, raza, sexo o religión. No se reconocen empleos ni privilegios hereditarios (art. 3). ","El párrafo 2 del artículo 63 (añadido con la reforma constitucional de 2014) reconoce a los pueblos indígenas y establece que el Estado adopte políticas a fin de mantener y desarrollar su identidad étnica y cultural, cosmovisión, valores y espiritualidad. ","Es deber del Estado proteger los recursos naturales, así como la diversidad e integridad del medio ambiente, para garantizar el desarrollo sostenible (art. 117). Además, se prohíben la introducción al territorio nacional de residuos nucleares y desechos tóxicos. Con respecto a la salud pública y ambiental, cabe destacar el artículo 69: el Estado proveerá los recursos necesarios e indispensables para el control permanente de la calidad de los productos químicos, farmacéuticos yveterinarios, por medio de organismos de vigilancia. Asimismo el Estado controlará la calidad de los productos alimenticios y las condiciones ambientales que puedan afectar la salud y el bienestar. ","El artículo 105 reconoce, fomenta y garantiza el derecho de propiedad privada sobre la tierra rústica, ya sea individual, cooperativa, comunal o en cualquier otra forma asociativa, y no podrá por ningún concepto reducir la extensión máxima de tierra que como derecho de propiedad establece esta Constitución. Se establece la extensión máxima de tierra rústica perteneciente a una misma persona, natural o jurídica (limitación no aplicable a asociaciones cooperativas o comunales campesinas). ","Se declara de interés social la protección, conservación, aprovechamiento racional, restauración o sustitución de los recursos naturales (art. 117). Siempre en tema de recursos naturales, se establece que el subsuelo pertenece al Estado, el cual podrá otorgar concesiones para su explotación (art. 103, párrafo 3). Véase asimismo el artículo 84: El territorio de la República sobre el cual El Salvador ejerce jurisdicción y soberanía es irreductible y además de la parte continental, comprende el territorio insular; las aguas territoriales y en comunidad del Golfo de Fonseca; el espacio aéreo, el subsuelo y la plataforma continental e insular correspondiente. Además, El Salvador ejerce soberanía y jurisdicción sobre el mar, el subsuelo y el lecho marinos hasta una distancia de 200 millas marinas contadas desde la línea de más baja marea, todo de conformidad a las regulaciones del derecho internacional. ","El artículo 104 se refiere a la propiedad estatal rústica con vocación agropecuaria y a la Reforma Agraria. El Estado fomentará el establecimiento, financiación y desarrollo de la agroindustria, en los distintos departamentos de la República, a fin de garantizar el empleo de mano de obra y la transformación de materias primas producidas por el sector agropecuario nacional (art. 105). Los artículos 266 y 267 refieren a las tierras objeto de Reforma Agraria y a los conceptos de campesino y agricultor en pequeño, que deberán definirse mediante ley.

The Law was approved on 8 May 1949 in Bonn, and, with the signature of the Western Allies of World War II on 12 May, came into effect on 23 May 1949. The German word «Grundgesetz» may be translated as either Basic Law or Fundamental Law. The term «Verfassung» (constitution) was not used, as the drafters regarded the «Grundgesetz» as temporary for the provisional West German state and that a constitution be formally enacted under the provision of article 146 of the Basic Law for an ultimate reunified Germany. However, when Germany was officially reunified (3 October 1990), no new Constitution was drafted, but the «Grundgesetz» was extended to the five new Länder (states). In 2002 article 20a was amended by adding the word “animals” after “natural foundations”(Lebensgrundlagen) so that animals, like humans, shall have the right to be respected by the state and to have their dignity protected (BGBl. I, p. 2862). All amendments up to and including the 59th Amendment of 11th July 2012 are included in the current version. ","The Law consists of 146 articles divided into 11 Parts as follows: Basic Rights (I); the Federation and the Länder (II); The Bundestag (III); The Bundesrat (IV); The Joint Committee (IVa); The Federal President (V); The Federal Government (VI); Federal Legislation and Legislative Procedures (VII); The Execution of Federal Laws and the Federal Administration (VIII); Joint Tasks (VIIIa); The Judiciary (IX); Finance (X); State of Defence (Xa); Transitional and Concluding Provisions (XI). ","Article 20 defines the Federal Republic of Germany as a democratic and social federal state and establishes that all state authority is derived from the people. It shall be exercised by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative, executive and judicial bodies. Also in the Länder the same principle prevails. Article 28 establishes that the constitutional order in the Länder must conform to the principles of a republican, democratic and social state governed by the rule of law, within the meaning of this Basic Law. Paragraph 3 of the same article states that the Federation shall guarantee that the constitutional order of the Länder conforms to the basic rights and to the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this article. Being a federal State sovereignty in Germany is shared between the Federal State and the 16 Länder (constituent states). The legislative competencies of the Federation and the Länder are regulated in detail by articles 71 to 75 listing the legislative powers of both. However, Land laws may not conflict with federal laws and article 31 of the Basic Law states that “Federal law shall take precedence over Land law.” This is intended to ensure that, as far as possible, “equitable living conditions” prevail throughout the federal territory. Germany is also defined a social or welfare state. This requires the political system to take precautions such that people are guaranteed a decent standard of material well-being in case of unemployment, disability, illness and in old age. ","The division of powers is one of the principles of Germany’s democracy and is anchored in the Basic Law. The powers of the state are divided between several branches, the legislative, the executive and the judiciary, which are supposed to monitor one another and limit the power of the state. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the making of law is a task performed by the country’s Parliament. The German “Bundestag” (Federal Diet) is therefore the most important organ of the legislative. It decides on all laws that fall within the sphere of competence of the German Federation in a legislative process that also requires the participation of the “Bundesrat” (Federal Council), a legislative body representing the 16 Länder of Germany. Since, under Germany’s federal system, the Länder hold a considerable share of the powers of the state, the Bundesrat also participates in the adoption of legislation. All acts are submitted to the Bundesrat for it to vote on and – depending on the nature of the proposed legislation – it may even cause the rejection of some proposals. Furthermore, the Bundesrat defends the interests of the Länder vis-à-vis the Federation and indirectly vis-à-vis the European Union and ensures that the political and administrative experience of the Länder is incorporated in the Federation's legislation and administration and in European Union affairs. Like the other constitutional organs of the Federation, the Bundesrat also bears its share of the overall responsibility for the Federal Republic of Germany. The Cabinet of Germany (German: Bundeskabinett or Bundesregierung) is the chief executive body of the Federal Republic of Germany. It consists of the Federal Chancellor, the head of the government, the most important person in German political day-to-day life, and the Cabinet ministers. The fundamentals of the Cabinet's organization as well as the method of its election and appointment as well as the procedure for its dismissal are set down in articles 62 through 69 of the Basic Law. Part of the executive branch is the Federal President whose tasks and powers are outlined in Part V (articles 54 to 61). He is the head of state and for protocol purposes the Federal President is the most important man in Germany. He is the constitutional organ which represents the Federal Republic of Germany both at home and abroad. The judicial system is established and governed by Part IX (arts. 92 to 104) of the Basic Law. Article 92 of the Basic Law establishes the courts, and specifies that the judicial power shall be vested in the judges; it shall be exercised by the Federal Constitutional Court, by the federal courts provided for in this Basic Law, and by the courts of the Länder”. Besides the Constitutional Court the judicial branch at the federal level is made up of five Supreme Courts — one for civil and criminal cases (Bundesgerichtshof), and one each for administrative (Bundesverwaltungsgericht), tax (Bundesfinanzhof), labour (Bundesarbeitsgericht), and social security (Bundessozialgericht) issues. There are also Länder based courts beneath them, and a rarely used senate of the supreme courts. Rechtsstaat (law-based state) and Rechtsstaatlichkeit (the German variant of the Rule of Law) are key concepts of the German Constitution to ensure provisions for the strict law-based exercise of power. Following the dark days of the Third Reich, the Rechtsstaat established in 1949 is wholly concerned with upholding humanist, liberal values, the protection of which is assigned primarily to the courts. The term Rechtsstaat tends, therefore, towards the ideal of a just state, while establishing a state governed by judges. However, it shall be underlined that the German Federal Constitutional Court has never actually supplied a comprehensive, overall definition of the general principle of Rechtsstaat. It adopts a cautious approach, setting forth the requirements deriving from it on a case-by-case basis. The principle of the Rechtsstaat consequently needs “to be given concrete expression according to the specific circumstances”. Nevertheless, in the Court’s view it appears to comprise two key elements: the idea of substantive justice through the protection of fundamental human rights (arts. 1 to 20) and the idea of legal certainty, i.e. bindingness of the law, the requirement of legislative precision, compliance with the principle of the hierarchy of legal rules, compliance with the principle of proportionality, judicial protection of rights. The Grundgesetz' concept of the rule of law is composed of various rules and principles on the state architecture, the structures of constitutional bodies and basic rights guarantees that comprise requirements for the state organization and procedure. Only two references to the term Rechtsstaat may be found in the German Basic Law. Since 1949, it has appeared in article 28 (1) which states that “the constitutional order in the Länder shall conform to the principles of the republican, democratic and social state governed by the Rule of Law within the meaning of this Basic Law”. Since the revision of 21 December 1992, the expression has also appeared in paragraph 1 of the new article 23 dealing with the European Union, which states that “with a view to establishing a united Europe the FRG shall participate in the development of the European Union, which is committed to democratic, rule-of-law, social and federal principles as well as to the principle of subsidiarity, and ensures protection of basic rights comparable in substance to that afforded by this Basic Law. Article 20 of the Grundgesetz comprises several rule of law principles, such as the separation of powers in paragraph 2, and in paragraph 3 the obligation of the legislation to the constitution and of the executive and the judiciary to law and justice (Gesetz und Recht). ","Article 25 on “Primacy of international law” establishes that “the general rules of international law shall be an integral part of federal law. They shall take precedence over the laws and directly create rights and duties for the inhabitants of the federal territory.” ","The Constitution of Germany puts a particular emphasis on human rights. Indeed, Part I (arts. 1 – 19) deals with Basic Rights. The first sentence of article 1 underlines this concept: “Human dignity is inviolable” (“Die Würde des Menschen is unantastbar”.) and is being interpreted as protecting the sum of human rights. Paragraph 1 of article 2 continues with the following: “To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority”. This paragraph is protected by an eternity clause which means that it cannot be changed. The following paragraphs read as follows: ”(2) The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world. (3) The following basic rights shall bind the legislature, the executive and the judiciary as directly applicable law”. Among other things, the other basic rights guarantee the freedom to act within the law, equality before the law, freedom of the press and media, freedom of association and protection of the family and the home. The Constitutions of the individual Länder also enumerate basic rights, differing in some cases from the Basic Law; since Federal law ranks higher, their provisions have valid effect only in so far as they guarantee more extensive rights. ","See Title 7.1. ","Article 14 lays down provisions relating to ownership and establishes expressly that “(1) Property and the right of inheritance shall be guaranteed. Their content and limits shall be defined by the laws. (…). (3) Expropriation shall only be permissible for the public good. It may only be ordered by or pursuant to a law that determines the nature and extent of compensation. Such compensation shall be determined by establishing an equitable balance between the public interest and the interests of those affected. In case of dispute concerning the amount of compensation, recourse may be had to the ordinary courts.” ","No specific provisions. ","No specific provisions regarding the right to water. ","Article 3 of the Basic Law contains provisions on gender equality: “(2) Men and women shall have equal rights. The state shall promote the actual implementation of equal rights for women and men and take steps to eliminate disadvantages that now exist.” ","No specific provisions. ","The following topics are mostly contained under article 74 of the Basic Law dealing with matters under “concurrent legislative powers”. That means that the Länder (constituent states) may legislate in a given field so long as the Federation makes no use of its regulatory powers. They lose this authority as soon as the Federation regulates the same matter comprehensively and exhaustively by statute. The Federation is permitted to do this only if there is an imperative need for the matter to be regulated uniformly throughout the Federal Republic. Article 20 makes mention of the environment in terms of “natural foundations” and establishes that “mindful also of its responsibility toward future generations, the state shall protect the natural foundations of life and animals by legislation and, in accordance with law and justice, by executive and judicial action, all within the framework of the constitutional order”. ","Article 29 provides for a new delimitation of the federal territory: “The division of the federal territory into Länder may be revised to ensure that each Land be of a size and capacity to perform its functions effectively. Due regard shall be given in this connection to regional, historical and cultural ties, economic efficiency, and the requirements of local and regional planning.” Paragraph 15 of article 74 establishes that “the transfer of land, natural resources, and means of production to public ownership or other forms of public enterprise” fall under concurrent legislation. See also Title 6.3. ","Article 15 on “Socialisation” establishes that “Land, natural resources and means of production may for the purpose of socialisation be transferred to public ownership or other forms of public enterprise by a law that determines the nature and extent of compensation.” Articles 70 to 74 concern the power of the Federation and the  Länder to legislation on natural resources, including water resources. The Federation shall be the owner of the former Reich waterways. ","Paragraph 17 of article 74 states that ‘the promotion of agricultural production and forestry (except for the law on land consolidation), ensuring the adequacy of food supply, the importation and exportation of agricultural and forestry products, deep-sea and coastal fishing, and preservation of the coasts” fall under concurrent legislative powers. ","No specific provisions. ","No specific provisions. ","Article 20 establishes that protective measures in connection with the marketing of agricultural and forest seeds and seedlings fall under concurrent legislation. ","Paragraph 19 of article 74 establishes that “measures to combat human and animal diseases which pose a danger to the public or are communicable, (omissis) as well as the law on pharmacies, medicines, medical products, drugs, narcotics and poisons” fall under concurrent legislative powers. Paragraph 20 of article 74 establishes that, inter alia. the law on food products including animals used in their production, (…) essential commodities and feedstuffs  (…) are part of concurrent legislation. Article 20 establishes that the State shall  protect both the foundations of life and animals by legislation. ",

A la fecha, el texto fue enmendado más de 200 veces. Cabe destacar la reforma constitucional de 2011, que introdujo los nuevos párrafos 2 y 3 del artículo 1º sobre la interpretación de las normas relativas a los derechos humanos y sobre la obligación de las autoridades, en el ámbito de sus competencias, de promover, respetar, proteger y garantizar los derechos humanos de conformidad con los principios de universalidad, interdependencia, indivisibilidad y progresividad. La reforma publicada en el Diario Oficial del 15 de agosto de 2016 se refiere al artículo 11 en tema de asilo político, mientras que la reforma de 2020 introdujo nuevas disposiciones en tema de derecho a la salud. El artículo 135 regula la reforma del texto constitucional: para las adiciones o reformas constitucionales se requiere que el Congreso de la Unión, por el voto de las dos terceras partes de los individuos presentes, acuerden las reformas o adiciones, y que éstas sean aprobadas por la mayoría de las legislaturas de los Estados y de la Ciudad de México. ","El texto de la Constitución consta de 136 artículos y 17 disposiciones transitorias, estructurados en nueve Títulos. El Título I se compone de cuatro Capítulos: I) De los Derechos Humanos y sus Garantías; II) De los Mexicanos; III) De los extranjeros; IV) De los ciudadanos mexicanos. El Título II incluye dos Capítulos: I) De la Soberanía Nacional y de la Forma de Gobierno; II) De las Partes Integrantes de la Federación y del Territorio Nacional. El Título III se compone de los siguientes Capítulos: I) De la división de poderes; II) Del Poder Legislativo; III) Del Poder Ejecutivo; IV) Del Poder Judicial. Los restantes Títulos que integran el texto constitucional son: IV) De las Responsabilidades de los Servidores Públicos, Particulares Vinculados con Faltas Administrativas Graves o Hechos de Corrupción, y Patrimonial del Estado; V) De los Estados de la Federación y de la Ciudad de México; VI) Del Trabajo y de la Previsión Social; VII) Prevenciones generales; VIII) De las reformas de la Constitución; IX) De la Inviolabilidad de la Constitución. ","México es una  República representativa, democrática, laica y federal, compuesta por Estados libres y soberanos en todo lo concerniente a su régimen interior, y por la Ciudad de México, unidos en una federación establecida según los principios de esta Constitución (art. 40). La soberanía nacional reside esencial y originariamente en el pueblo. Todo poder público dimana del pueblo y se instituye para beneficio de éste. El pueblo tiene en todo tiempo el inalienable derecho de alterar o modificar la forma de su gobierno (art. 39). El pueblo ejerce su soberanía por medio de los Poderes de la Unión, en los casos de la competencia de éstos, y por los de los Estados y la Ciudad de México, en lo que toca a sus regímenes interiores, en los términos respectivamente establecidos por la presente Constitución Federal y las particulares de cada Estado y de la Ciudad de México (art. 41). El artículo 43 enumera los Estados que integran la Federación. ","El Supremo Poder de la Federación se divide para su ejercicio en Legislativo, Ejecutivo y Judicial. El poder legislativo de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos se deposita en un Congreso general, que se dividirá en dos Cámaras, una de diputados y otra de senadores (art. 50). El artículo 73 enumera las áreas de competencia para legiferar del Congreso de la Federación. El Poder Ejecutivo lo ejerce el Presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, quien será elegido por sufragio universal directamente por el pueblo (arts. 80-81). El Poder Judicial de la Federación lo ejercen una Suprema Corte de Justicia, un Tribunal Electoral, Tribunales Colegiados y Unitarios de Circuito y Juzgados de Distrito (art. 94). En cuanto a los gobiernos estatales, el principio general es que los estados adoptarán, para su régimen interior, la forma de gobierno republicano, representativo, democrático, laico y popular, teniendo como base de su división territorial y de su organización política y administrativa, el municipio libre, conforme a las bases indicadas en el artículo 115. El artículo 116 establece los principios generales que rigen el ejercicio de los tres poderes (legislativo, ejecutivo y judicial) por parte de los Estados. Las relaciones entre Federación y Estados están contempladas bajo el Título Quinto. ","Con respecto al estatus de las obligaciones internacionales, cabe destacar lo que establece el artículo 133: Esta Constitución, las leyes del Congreso de la Unión que emanen de ella y todos los Tratados que estén de acuerdo con la misma, celebrados y que se celebren por el Presidente de la República, con aprobación del Senado, serán la Ley Suprema de toda la Unión. Los jueces de cada Estado se arreglarán a dicha Constitución, leyes y tratados, a pesar de las disposiciones en contrario que pueda haber en las Constituciones o leyes de los Estados. Por otro lado, en tema de derechos humanos el artículo 1 establece que en los Estados Unidos Mexicanos todas las personas gozarán de los derechos humanos reconocidos en esta Constitución y en los tratados internacionales de los que el Estado Mexicano sea parte; las normas relativas a los derechos humanos se interpretarán de conformidad con esta Constitución y con los tratados internacionales de la materia favoreciendo en todo tiempo a las personas la protección más amplia. ","Como mencionado, el Título I está dedicado a los derechos y garantías de las personas y los ciudadanos. Los derechos individuales incluyen el derecho a la vida, la libertad de expresión, el derecho al acceso a la información. También se contempla el derecho a la salud. Con respecto a este último, la reforma de 2020 elevó a rango constitucional a rango constitucional los programas sociales de pensión universal para adultos mayores y la salud universal. La reforma dispuso adiciones al artículo 4º en materia de bienestar, para garantizar derechos, beneficios económicos y salud universal a grupos vulnerables, adultos mayores, indígenas, afromexicanos, discapacitados y a estudiantes de todos los niveles. ","Artículo 4, párrafo 5: Toda persona tiene derecho a un medio ambiente sano para su desarrollo y bienestar. El Estado garantizará el respeto a este derecho. El daño y deterioro ambiental generará responsabilidad para quien lo provoque en términos de lo dispuesto por la ley. ","En tema de propiedad privada, véanse los artículos 14 y 27. La nación tendrá en todo tiempo el derecho de imponer a la propiedad privada las modalidades que dicte el interés público, así como el de regular, en beneficio social, el aprovechamiento de los elementos naturales susceptibles de apropiación, con objeto de hacer una distribución equitativa de la riqueza pública, cuidar de su conservación, lograr el desarrollo equilibrado del país y el mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida de la población rural y urbana. ","Artículo 4, párrafo 3: Toda persona tiene derecho a la alimentación nutritiva, suficiente y de calidad. El Estado lo garantizará. ","El párrafo 6º del artículo 4º reconoce el derecho de acceso al agua: toda persona tiene derecho al acceso, disposición y saneamiento de agua para consumo personal y doméstico en forma suficiente, salubre, aceptable y asequible. El Estado garantizará este derecho y la ley definirá las bases, apoyos y modalidades para el acceso y uso equitativo y sustentable de los recursos hídricos, estableciendo la participación de la Federación, las entidades federativas y los municipios, así como la participación de la ciudadanía para la consecución de dichos fines. ","El varón y la mujer son iguales ante la ley (art. 4, párrafo 1). ","El artículo 2º reconoce los derechos de los pueblos indígenas. La Nación tiene una composición pluricultural sustentada originalmente en sus pueblos indígenas que son aquellos que descienden de poblaciones que habitaban en el territorio actual del país al iniciarse la colonización y que conservan sus propias instituciones sociales, económicas, culturales y políticas, o parte de ellas. En este sentido la Constitución reconoce y garantiza el derecho de los pueblos y las comunidades indígenas a la libre determinación y, en consecuencia, a la autonomía para, entre otros aspectos: a) decidir sus formas internas de convivencia y organización social, económica, política y cultural; b) aplicar sus propios sistemas normativos en la regulación y solución de sus conflictos internos, sujetándose a los principios generales de esta Constitución, respetando las garantías individuales, los derechos humanos y, de manera relevante, la dignidad e integridad de las mujeres; c) conservar y mejorar el hábitat y preservar la integridad de sus tierras; d) acceder, con respeto a las formas y modalidades de propiedad y tenencia de la tierra establecidas en esta Constitución y a las leyes de la materia, así como a los derechos adquiridos por terceros o por integrantes de la comunidad, al uso y disfrute preferente de los recursos naturales de los lugares que habitan y ocupan las comunidades. Se contempla expresamente su derecho al Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado. ","El daño y deterioro ambiental generará responsabilidad para quien lo provoque en términos de lo dispuesto por la ley (art. 4, párrafo 5). Cabe asimismo destacar lo establecido en el artículo 25, párrafo 7: bajo criterios de equidad social, productividad y sustentabilidad el Estado apoyará e impulsará a las empresas de los sectores social y privado de la economía, sujetándolos a las modalidades que dicte el interés público y al uso, en beneficio general, de los recursos productivos, cuidando su conservación y el medio ambiente. ","Ver el artículo 27 en tema de propiedad pública y privada de las tierras. La propiedad de las tierras y aguas comprendidas dentro de los límites del territorio nacional, corresponde originariamente a la Nación, la cual ha tenido y tiene el derecho de transmitir el dominio de ellas a los particulares, constituyendo la propiedad privada. Las expropiaciones sólo podrán hacerse por causa de utilidad pública y mediante indemnización. El mismo artículo 27 contempla condiciones específicos para el acceso a la tierra por parte de extranjeros: Sólo los mexicanos por nacimiento o por naturalización y las sociedades mexicanas tienen derecho para adquirir el dominio de las tierras, aguas y sus accesiones o para obtener concesiones de explotación de minas o aguas. El Estado podrá conceder el mismo derecho a los extranjeros, siempre que convengan ante la Secretaría de Relaciones en considerarse como nacionales respecto de dichos bienes y en no invocar por lo mismo la protección de sus gobiernos por lo que se refiere a aquéllos. En los Estados Unidos Mexicanos quedan prohibidos los latifundios. ","El artículo 27 párrafo 4 introduce normas específicas sobre el dominio del Estado y los recursos naturales. Corresponde a la Nación el dominio directo de todos los recursos naturales de la plataforma continental y los zócalos submarinos de las islas; de todos los minerales o substancias que en vetas, mantos, masas o yacimientos, constituyan depósitos cuya naturaleza sea distinta de los componentes de los terrenos, tales como los minerales de los que se extraigan metales y metaloides utilizados en la industria; los yacimientos de piedras preciosas, de sal de gema y las salinas formadas directamente por las aguas marinas; los productos derivados de la descomposición de las rocas, cuando su explotación necesite trabajos subterráneos; los yacimientos minerales u orgánicos de materias susceptibles de ser utilizadas como fertilizantes; los combustibles minerales sólidos; el petróleo y todos los carburos de hidrógeno sólidos, líquidos o gaseosos; y el espacio situado sobre el territorio nacional, en la extensión y términos que fije el Derecho Internacional. ","En tema de propiedad agrícola, se prohíbe los latifundios. El artículo 27 contiene la definición de pequeña propiedad agrícola. En tema de empleo rural, se establece que toda empresa agrícola (como así también industrial, minera o de cualquier otra clase de trabajo), estará obligada, según lo determinen las leyes reglamentarias a proporcionar a los trabajadores habitaciones cómodas e higiénicas. ","Véase el artículo 27. La energía nuclear podrá utilizarse solamente con fines pacíficos. ","El artículo 73 dispone la facultad del Congreso de la Federación de expedir leyes que establezcan la concurrencia del gobierno federal, de los gobiernos de las entidades federativas y de los municipios, en el ámbito de sus respectivas competencias, en materia de pesca y acuacultura, así como la participación de los sectores social y privado. ","En tema de expropiación, el artículo 27 hace referencia a las tierras forestales: el Estado adoptará las medidas necesarias para ordenar los asentamientos humanos y establecer adecuadas provisiones, usos, reservas y destinos de tierras, aguas y bosques, a efecto de ejecutar obras públicas y de planear y regular la fundación, conservación, mejoramiento y crecimiento de los centros de población. ","Con respecto a la propiedad agrícola relacionada con la ganadería, el artículo 27 dispone que Se considerará pequeña propiedad ganadera la que no exceda por individuo la superficie necesaria para mantener hasta quinientas cabezas de ganado mayor o su equivalente en ganado menor, en los términos que fije la ley, de acuerdo con la capacidad forrajera de los terrenos.

La soberanía radica en el pueblo y se ejerce a través de los órganos del poder público y de las formas de participación directa previstas en la Constitución (art. 1º).

La ley sancionará toda forma de discriminación. En tema de no discriminación cabe asimismo destacar el artículo 393, en virtud del cual el Estado garantizará la seguridad humana a través de políticas y acciones integradas, para asegurar la convivencia pacífica de las personas, promover una cultura de paz y prevenir las formas de violencia y discriminación y la comisión de infracciones y delitos. ","Las comunidades, pueblos, y nacionalidades indígenas, el pueblo afroecuatoriano, el pueblo montubio y las comunas forman parte del Estado ecuatoriano, único e indivisible.

Por otro lado, se promueve la redistribución de tierras con finalidades productivas: será responsabilidad del Estado, entre otras, promover políticas redistributivas que permitan el acceso del campesinado a la tierra, al agua y otros recursos productivos (art. 281). Las personas naturales o jurídicas extranjeras no podrán adquirir a ningún título tierras o concesiones en las áreas de seguridad nacional ni en áreas protegidas, de acuerdo con la ley (art. 405).

El artículo 395 fija los principios ambientales, entre los cuales cabe destacar el modelo sustentable de desarrollo, ambientalmente equilibrado y respetuoso de la diversidad cultural, que conserve la biodiversidad y la capacidad de regeneración natural de los ecosistemas, y asegure la satisfacción de las necesidades de las generaciones presentes y futuras. ","La Constitución declara de interés público conservar la biodiversidad agrícola. Por otro lado, se prevé brindar a los agricultores y a las comunidades rurales apoyo para la conservación y restauración de los suelos, así como para el desarrollo de prácticas agrícolas que los protejan y promuevan la soberanía alimentaria (art. 410). Para lograr la soberanía alimentaria, se hace hincapié en la promoción de actividades agrícolas diversificadas (art. 281). Ver también el artículo 373 en materia de seguro social campesino. ","En materia energética, el Estado promueve energías alternativas no contaminantes y de bajo impacto. Por otro lado, la soberanía energética no se alcanzará en detrimento de la soberanía alimentaria, ni afectará el derecho al agua (art. 15). En cuanto a la soberanía energética, ver también los artículos 314, 326 y 334. ","Ver el artículo 281. En tema de seguro social campesino, el artículo 373 contempla también la pesca artesanal. ","Ver el artículo 407 en materia de explotación de recursos naturales: se prohíbe la actividad extractiva de recursos no renovables en las áreas protegidas y en zonas declaradas como intangibles, incluida la explotación forestal.
